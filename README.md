# tweetPOS

Implementation of a POS tagger for tweets as an excercise for CS590-NLP
at Purdue University.

The goal is to compare the performance of local training (HMM and MEMM) and global training (Structured Perceptron) models on this task. I used the experimental set up of [Gimpel et. al](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/TweetNLP/gimpel+etal.acl11.pdf) for testing.
